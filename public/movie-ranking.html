<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Ramayana: The Legend of Prince Rama</h3>
<p>I saw this movie when I was a little kid and I've been in love with this movie since then. Animation, music, voice overs, everything is brilliant. Since the Ramayana cannot be completely illustrated within two-three hours but still, this is amazing. A must watch movie. And yes, do not watch this movie thinking you are going to watch a cartoon or something.</p>

<h3>Gol Maal</h3>
<p>A comedy of errors in which a lie and a mistaken identity sets into motion a domino effect of such proportions that every time a character faces an obstacle your heart leaps into your mouth, only to fall back with a thud because you continuously feel the urge to laugh uncontrollably.</p>

<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>Awesome film man. Saw this with my family in a theatre. Worth every penny n worth every minute. Never seen such an amazing film from Bollywood. What is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. The last 30 mins were beautifully shot. Very good direction by Hirani. The star cast is good n Aamir khan steals the show. The editing is top notch. U don't feel bore for even a sec. Awesome screenplay. It's hands down the best film in the history of Bollywood.</p>
